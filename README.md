# Written Words
Today I learned how words are a mirror image of a fragmented world, loosly tying thoughts by threads and strings together to convey,
which is not at all conclusive. It might be feelings trying to be expressed, other times the struggle and lack of words to be imprinted onto the surface of what is really there and deep below. Words might be self assuring, self proclaiming, self exploring, halfway erased-rejuggled-reasembled, a play, or a syntax for infusion and development of thought on the plane. Meaning can reveal itself to who writes and reads halfway through, or its trace be lost and fizzle out. Words might be structuredly typed, surgically- grammatically composed in blocks or - penfully spiraled in cascading flows, glissening. Or paced in the wrong way, purposefully stumbling the reader. Or they might be the analysis, the dis-pattern seeking, labling and categorizing, self refinding. The words choose their ear. One only holds the power of shaping and turning their kosmos before expanding it into context and time and space. 


The author is recommended to sprinkle in a dose of each, as it confuses both the author and the reader.

If only someone had revealed the axiomatic definition of words to me earlier.
As we should know what we do not in order to use it.

I can only offer one thing: You can see words changing through time and space by inspecting the commit history.
