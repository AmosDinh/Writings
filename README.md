# Writings
Using this as a way to write some words.
I learned today that texts are a mirror image of a fragmented world, loosly tying thoughts by threads and strings together to convey  meaning.
Which is not at all conclusive. Sometimes it might be feelings that the author is trying to express, sometimes the struggle and lack of words to imprint onto the surface what is really there or deep below is what is felt by the reader. Text might be self assuring, self proclaiming, self exploring, halfway erased-rejuggled-reasembled, a play of words, or a syntax for infusing and developing thought itself on the plane. Meaning can reveal itself to who writes and reads halfway through, or its trace be lost and fizzle out. Words might be structuredly typed, surgically- grammatically composed in blocks or - penfully spiraled in cascading flows, glissening. Or paced in the wrong way, purposefully stumbling the reader. Or they might be the analysis, the dis-pattern seeking, labling and categorizing, self recursing medium. The text chooses its audiens. The author only holds the power of shaping and turning its kosmos before releasing it into context and time and space. 


The author is recommended to sprinkle in a dose of each, as it confuses both the author and the reader.

If only someone had revealed the axiomatic definition of words to me earlier.
As we should know what we do not in order to use it.

I can only offer one thing: You can see this text changing through time and space by looking into the commit history.
