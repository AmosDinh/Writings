Using this as a way to write some words.
I learned today that texts are a mirror image of a fragmented world, loosly tying thoughts by threads and strings together to convey  meaning.
Which is not at all conclusive. Sometimes it might be feelings that the author is trying to express, sometimes the struggle and lack of words to imprint onto the surface what is really there or deep below is what is felt by the reader. Text might be self assuring, self proclaiming, self exploring, halfway erased rejuggled and reasembled, a play of words, or syntax for infusing and developing thought itself on the plane. Meaning can reveal itself to whom writes and reads halfway through, or its trace be lost and fizzle out. Words might be structuredly typed, surgically,- grammatically reassembled in blocks or - penfully spiraled in cascading flows, glissening. Or paced in the wrong way, purposefully letting the reader stumble. Or it might be the analyzing and dis-pattern seeking, labling, self recursing type of medium. The text will choose its audience. The author only holds the power of bending and turning it before releasing it into context of time and space. 

The author is not recommended to sprinkle in a dose of each, as it might confuse both the author and the reader - or maybe thats the point.

Had someone revealed this in an axiomatic way to me some years earlier, I would have come to realize its usefulness in it standing earlier as well. 
As we should know what we don't in order to use it.
