# Writings
Using this as a way to write some words.
I learned today that texts are a mirror image of a fragmented world, loosly tying thoughts by threads and strings together to convey  meaning.
Which is not at all conclusive. Sometimes it might be feelings that the author is trying to express, sometimes the struggle and lack of words to imprint onto the surface what is really there or deep below is what is felt by the reader. Text might be self assuring, halfway erased rejuggled and reasembled, a play of words, or syntax for infusing and developing thought itself on the plane. Meaning can reveal itself to whom writes and reads halfway through, or its trace be lost and fizzle out. Words might be structuredly typed, surgically,- grammatically reassembled in blocks or penfully spiraled in cascading flows, glissening. Or paced in the wrong way, purposefully letting the reader stumble.

The author might sprinkle in a dose of each, or be forced to do so by the audience the text will choose. 

Had someone revealed this in an axiomatic way to me some years earlier, I would have come to exploring it a little earlier. 
As we should know what we don't in order to use it.
