Text might be self assuring, halfway erased rejuggled and reasembled, a play of words, or syntax for thought itself. Meaning can reveal itself to the author or the reader halfway through or its trace be lost and fade. Words might be structuredly typed, surgically,- grammatically reassembled in blocks or penfully spiraled in cascading flows, glissening.
